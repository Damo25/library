# Two-Tier Client-Server Architecture for System Design

## Context and Problem Statement

The system architecture must support the development of a web application requiring clear separation of concerns, efficient collaboration between teams, and scalability to handle growth. The project includes distinct frontend and backend components managed by dedicated teams. Selecting an appropriate architecture will ensure smooth development, deployment, and maintenance.

---

## Decision Drivers

* **Separation of Concerns**: Maintain a clean division between the frontend and backend to support independent development.
* **Team Collaboration**: Enable efficient communication and workflow between the frontend and backend teams.
* **Scalability**: Ensure the system can handle increasing user loads and data demands.
* **Maintainability**: Simplify debugging, updates, and testing by isolating issues to the client or server layer.
* **Performance**: Provide a responsive user experience and ensure efficient data communication.

---

## Considered Options

1. **Monolithic Architecture**  
2. **Two-Tier Client-Server Architecture**  
3. **Microservices Architecture**

---

## Decision Outcome

**Chosen Option**: **Two-Tier Client-Server Architecture**

The Two-Tier Client-Server Architecture aligns with the project requirements. By separating the frontend (client) and backend (server), the architecture enables focused development and ensures scalability, maintainability, and performance. The backend serves as a central data and logic repository, while the frontend handles the user interface and interaction.

---

### Consequences

* **Good**:  
  * Clear separation of concerns enables parallel development by frontend and backend teams.  
  * Simplifies debugging and maintenance by isolating issues to the client or server layer.  
  * Efficient communication through well-documented APIs ensures smooth data exchange.  
  * Scalable design supports future growth in users and features.

* **Bad**:  
  * Frontend and backend teams must align closely on API specifications and updates.  
  * Backend performance becomes a bottleneck if not optimized for high load.

---

### Confirmation

The implementation of the Two-Tier Client-Server Architecture will be validated through:  
- **Integration Testing**: Verify API communication between frontend and backend.  
- **Load Testing**: Ensure backend performance under high user loads.  
- **User Acceptance Testing**: Confirm a seamless and responsive user experience.  
- **Code Reviews**: Maintain clean, consistent, and modular codebases for both layers.

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Monolithic Architecture

* **Good**:  
  * Simple implementation for small-scale systems.  
  * Unified codebase for tightly coupled components.  

* **Bad**:  
  * Poor scalability for larger systems.  
  * Difficult to maintain and update due to tight coupling.

---

### Two-Tier Client-Server Architecture

* **Good**:  
  * Supports independent development of client and server components.  
  * Facilitates scalability and modular design.  
  * Easier debugging and maintenance with clear separation of layers.

* **Bad**:  
  * Requires precise coordination between frontend and backend teams.  
  * Backend performance must be optimized to avoid bottlenecks.

---

### Microservices Architecture

* **Good**:  
  * High scalability and fault isolation through independent services.  
  * Ideal for complex, distributed systems with diverse functionalities.

* **Bad**:  
  * High complexity in managing inter-service communication.  
  * Requires significant infrastructure and management overhead.
