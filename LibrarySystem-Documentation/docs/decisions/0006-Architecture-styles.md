# Three-Tier Architecture for System Design

## Context and Problem Statement

The system architecture must support the development of a web application requiring clear separation of concerns, efficient collaboration between teams, and scalability to handle growth. The project includes distinct frontend, backend, and database components managed by dedicated teams. Selecting an appropriate architecture will ensure smooth development, deployment, and maintenance.

---

## Decision Drivers

* **Separation of Concerns**: Maintain a clean division between the presentation, application logic, and data layers to support independent development.
* **Team Collaboration**: Enable efficient communication and workflow between the frontend, backend, and database teams.
* **Scalability**: Ensure the system can handle increasing user loads, complex business logic, and large-scale data demands.
* **Maintainability**: Simplify debugging, updates, and testing by isolating issues to specific layers.
* **Performance**: Provide a responsive user experience and ensure efficient processing of application logic and data communication.

## Considered Options

1. **Monolithic Architecture**  
2. **Two-Tier Client-Server Architecture**  
3. **Three-Tier Architecture**  
4. **Microservices Architecture**

---

## Decision Outcome

**Chosen Option**: **Three-Tier Architecture**

The Three-Tier Architecture aligns with the project requirements. By separating the application into presentation (client), application logic (server), and data (database) tiers, the architecture enables focused development, ensures scalability, maintainability, and performance. The backend acts as an intermediary between the client and database, processing business logic and ensuring secure, efficient data access.

---

### Consequences

* **Good**:  
  * Clear separation of concerns enables parallel development by frontend, backend, and database teams.  
  * Enhances scalability by isolating application logic and data management.  
  * Facilitates maintainability and debugging with distinct layers.  
  * Allows optimized performance by tailoring each tier to its specific role.

* **Bad**:  
  * Increases complexity compared to two-tier systems.  
  * Requires careful management of interactions between layers.  
  * May introduce latency if tiers are not properly optimized.

---

### Confirmation

The implementation of the Three-Tier Architecture will be validated through:  
- **Integration Testing**: Verify communication between frontend, backend, and database layers.  
- **Load Testing**: Ensure performance under high user and data loads.  
- **User Acceptance Testing**: Confirm a seamless and responsive user experience.  
- **Code Reviews**: Maintain clean, consistent, and modular codebases for all layers.

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Monolithic Architecture

* **Good**:  
  * Simple implementation for small-scale systems.  
  * Unified codebase for tightly coupled components.  

* **Bad**:  
  * Poor scalability for larger systems.  
  * Difficult to maintain and update due to tight coupling.

---

### Two-Tier Client-Server Architecture

* **Good**:  
  * Supports independent development of client and server components.  
  * Facilitates scalability and modular design.  
  * Easier debugging and maintenance with clear separation of layers.

* **Bad**:  
  * Backend performance becomes a bottleneck under high data demands.  
  * Limited separation of application logic and data management.

---

### Three-Tier Architecture

* **Good**:  
  * Clear separation of presentation, logic, and data layers.  
  * Enables scalability and optimized performance for each tier.  
  * Supports independent team workflows and modular development.  

* **Bad**:  
  * More complex to implement and manage than two-tier systems.  
  * Potential latency if communication between tiers is inefficient.

---

### Microservices Architecture

* **Good**:  
  * High scalability and fault isolation through independent services.  
  * Ideal for complex, distributed systems with diverse functionalities.

* **Bad**:  
  * High complexity in managing inter-service communication.  
  * Requires significant infrastructure and management overhead.
