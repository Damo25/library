# {fornt end framework to be used for the project which has been decided as React/vue.js}

## Context and Problem Statement

{which FrontEnd tech stack to be used for front end development of the library systems website. we have a few differant types of front end technoldgy we are deciding from and shown in the considering options. due to the nature of the project we need to decide on the most effective and usable technoldgy for the team.}

## Decision Drivers

* {having a clash between the backend and front end}
* {team understanding problems with the technoldgy chosen}

## Considered Options

* {React}
* {Bootstrap}
* {Vue.js}

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "{React}", because {react is going to be the main fraimwork that with maily agree on for the project as this is up to date on updates compared to other options eg bootstrap and with view.js this will be used together with react for development, this one fills both of the decision drivers as it is well known by the members of the team meaning for smooth development of the project with a low chance for error of use with the technoldgy. with the backend we are deciding on being python with flask this will work with react with little to no clashes}.


### Consequences

* Good, because {Due to the compatability of this framework with the team and other technoldgys chosen error during development should be low risk}
* Bad, because {Due to the nature of react and flask we might have to do some seperation of the front and back end during the development}



### Confirmation

{Describe how the implementation of/compliance with the ADR can/will be confirmed. Is the chosen design and its implementation in line with the decision? E.g., a design/code review or a test with a library such as ArchUnit can help validate this. Note that although we classify this element as optional, it is included in many ADRs.}


## Pros and Cons of the Options

### {react}


{}

* Good, because {Very compatible with the other tech stacks being used which will mean no clashing and easy working enviroment with little to no error}
* Good, because {team all understands the tech stack}

* Neutral, because {due to the nature of chosen tech stacks we may have to seperate some of the development of back and front end whioch could cause confusuion but would be able to work with this}
* Bad, because {is a time consuming tech stack to use which could cause problems with the delevery of the software}


### {bootstrap}

{}

* Good, because {very simple to use framework meaning would be less time consuming and easier to use for the project}
* Good, because {works with the chosen tech stacks so will be easy to set up and use}
* Neutral, because {due to the backend being used we may have to seperate some of the development which could cause issue but we can work with it}
* Bad, because {not updated very often so this framework is outdated causing the software to look outdated and not as up to date could also cause clash issue with other tech stacks}


### {Vue.js}

{}

* Good, because {extremely good for front end development changing the structure to a component style development which is extremely effiecent meaning for better and more tidy work flow also allowing for the website to run with little risk and easy for the team to work with}
* Good, because {works with the chosen tech stacks so will be easy to set up and use as react is made to be intergrated with vue.js}
* Neutral, because {due to the backend being used we may have to seperate some of the development which could cause issue but we can work with it}
* Bad, because {setting this up isnt as quick and easy as some frameworks}



## More Information

{we have decided to work with react and vue.js as they can be used together and will fit the most with our project making development as efficent as possible and the end porduct will be the best quality it can be. we decided not to go with bootstrap as even with the efficency of this framework due to updating issue with how outdated this is and how this would effect the project we have decided to not go with this for the project}
